Layup is an invite platform which uses dribbble api.

dribbble.com has an invitation model.

:page_with_curl: What's the invitation model?

An invitation system is a method of encouraging people to join an organization, such as a club or a website. In regular society, it refers to any system whereby new members are chosen; they cannot simply apply.

tl;dr: If you're a talented designer and you want to add your works on dribbble, you need an invitation!

### :incoming_envelope: How can you get invitation from dribbble?

You can get invitation only from dribbble players (users) who has an invitation.

This projects' first aim is help to talented designers quickly become to a dribbble player.

### How it works?

:art: Firstly who're you? a dribbble player or prospect?

1. **You're a talented designer and also you don't have an invitation**

- First of all, you need a dribbble account. If you don't have one, go for it, https://dribbble.com/ and sign-up.
